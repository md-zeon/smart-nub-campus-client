## Architecture

### Dual API Client

The app uses two API clients for different contexts:

1. **`serverApi`** (`src/lib/server-api.ts`) — For server components and server actions. Forwards cookies from Next.js, supports cache tags for automatic invalidation after mutations.

2. **`apiClient`** (`src/lib/api-client.ts`) — For client components. Runs in the browser using `fetch` directly with `credentials: "include"`.

Services are split accordingly (e.g., `ai.service.ts` for server, `ai.client.service.ts` for client).

### Server Components + Client Hydration

Most list pages are **Server Components** that pre-fetch data and pass it as props to interactive **Client Components**. Detail pages (discussions, questions, resources) are typically Client Components that fetch via server actions in `useEffect`.

### Real-time via Socket.IO

`useSocket` + `useSocketEvent` hooks manage a persistent WebSocket connection with heartbeat, auto-reconnect, and typed events for messaging, notifications, typing indicators, and presence.

### Cache Invalidation

Services pass `invalidatesTags` to `serverApi` mutations, which triggers automatic revalidation after successful writes.

## Custom Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `useDebounce` | Debounce values (search inputs) |
| `usePagination` | Pagination state with optional URL sync |
| `useInfiniteScroll` | IntersectionObserver-based infinite scroll |
| `useSocket` | Socket.IO connection with heartbeat and auto-reconnect |
| `useSocketEvent` | Subscribe to typed Socket.IO events |
| `useNotifications` | Notification list state management |
| `useUnreadCount` | Global unread count with real-time updates |
| `useUpload` | File upload hook |
| `useEmailVerification` | Full OTP verification flow with countdown |
| `useMediaQuery` | CSS media query matching |
| `useAsRef` | Ref that always holds latest value |
| `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` | SSR-safe useLayoutEffect |
| `useLazyRef` | Lazy-initialized ref |

## Component Library

UI primitives are built as shadcn-style components:
- Built on [Base UI](https://baseui.com) + [@radix-ui/react-slot](https://radix-ui.com)
- Styled with [CVA](https://cva.style) for variant management
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- 28 custom icon components wrapping lucide-react
- 14 skeleton loading states for all major views

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API URL

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

All variables below are validated at runtime via `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` (`src/env.ts`). Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill every value — the app will fail fast at startup if a required variable is missing.

| Variable | Required | Scope | Description |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `BACKEND_URL` | Yes | Server-only | Backend base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Server-only | Frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `API_URL` | Yes | Server-only | Full API endpoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`) |
| `AUTH_URL` | Yes | Server-only | Better Auth endpoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | Server-only | `development` or `production` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | Yes | Public | Backend base URL for the browser (Better Auth client, Socket.IO) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Public | Frontend URL for the browser |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Yes | Public | Backend API URL for the browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Yes | Public | Cloudinary cloud name |

> **Security note:** Never prefix secrets with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — anything prefixed that way is bundled into the browser. Keep API keys and auth secrets server-only.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest unit tests |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage |

## Deployment

Production checklist and best-practice gaps are tracked in [`Review/05-DEPLOYMENT-READINESS.md`](../Review/05-DEPLOYMENT-READINESS.md) at the repository root.

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

> **Note:** the final pre-deployment security review (2026-08-10) found Critical/High issues that must be resolved before going live. See [`Review/00-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`](../Review/00-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md).
